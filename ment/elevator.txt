Through my academic and personal projects, 
I’ve gained hands-on experience across the entire tech stack.

am always looking for ways to optimize and innovate.

I believe that my technical skills, combined with essential soft skills such as 
teamwork, collaboration, conflict resolution, adaptability, and flexibility,
