# Importance of Praise , admiration and Thank you  
# Laura Trice
Sometimes we want to say Thank you or Praise someone but then we dont.
we fell shy and embrassesd to do that.
She asks the same question to herself. why?
She is fortunate to work in a Rehab facility.
Where she gets to see the people who are facing life and death with addiction.
And sometimes it comes down to this to them that their core wound is 
There father dies without saying he is proud of them 
but then they hear it from some other family memebers that the father told everybody 
else that he is proud of him , but he never told the son .
beacuse he didnt know the son needed to hear this .
So its important for us to ask what we need to hear  and ask others
what they need to hear.
Praise the ones who genuinvely do good things for us.
and do good things and ask for the praise we deserve.
