# Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Pripyat, Ukraine
Chernobyl refers to the site basically where the Chernobyl disaster took place.
It took place on April 26, 1986 and is considered one of most catastrophic nuclear disasters in history.

- explosion and subsequent fires in Reactor 4 released large amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere.

# Cause:

A flawed reactor design and 
inadequately trained personnel.

# Immediate Impact:

Two plant workers died on the night of the explosion.
Dozens of workers and emergency responders succumbed to acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the following weeks.

# Long-Term Effects:

- Widespread radioactive contamination resulted in the evacuation of over 300,000 people from nearby areas.
- The town of Pripyat remains abandoned and is part of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, a highly restricted area.
- Increased rates of thyroid cancer and other health issues have been linked to the disaster, especially in children exposed to radiation.

- Over time, some wildlife populations have adapted and even thrived in the absence of human activity, though they carry radiation risks.


- although it had very less immediate deaths but overtime there are estimated 1000s of deaths due to radiation-induced illnesses.
