Good Evening!

Today, we’re diving into a thought-provoking yet powerful concept—Universal Basic Income, or UBI. Let’s kick things off with a “Did You Know?” moment.

Did you know that, according to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) program, around 80 million out of 1.2 billion Indians—approximately 6.7% of the population—lived below the poverty line of ₹90 per day in 2019? Moreover, 84% of Indians survived on less than ₹495 per day.

Adding to that, over 10 crore Indians are unemployed, and India’s part-time employment rate stands at 24% of total employment, with a large chunk of this percentage being students working to make ends meet.

Now, imagine a scenario where the Government of India provides every citizen with a regular, unconditional sum of money—irrespective of their income, job status, or background. What would happen then? The poverty line would effectively rise by the amount given by the government, plus the existing baseline, helping both those below the poverty line and those struggling with unstable employment or part-time jobs, such as students.

This is where Universal Basic Income comes into play—a mechanism aimed at shifting the poverty line. UBI proposes a regular payment to all citizens, ensuring a safety net that doesn’t depend on your job or financial status.

Here’s how it works:

Regular Payments: Each citizen receives a fixed sum of money at consistent intervals, typically monthly.
Unconditional: There are no strings attached—no need to prove employment or financial need. Everyone qualifies for UBI, regardless of their situation.
Cash-Based: Payments are made in cash, providing complete freedom to spend it however one chooses. This maximizes flexibility and autonomy.
Universal: The system covers everyone within the target population, making it truly inclusive.
The beauty of UBI is that it minimizes bureaucratic hurdles while offering a straightforward solution to poverty and financial insecurity. By providing a steady income to all, it offers a new way to think about economic support in an increasingly uncertain world.
