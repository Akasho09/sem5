<!-- 
I made my decision to choose a college based on my JEE exams as a reference. 
At that time, I didn’t follow a systematic analysis. If I were to make this decision now, 
I would approach it differently. I would apply the steps we studied:

Defining the Problem: Deciding between branch and college.
Gathering Information and Collecting Data.
Developing and Weighing the Options: I don’t think I did this properly back then. Weighting branch more will i still do.
Even now, I would prioritize the branch more, so choosing a college with a better branch would still be my decision. 
This is what I did earlier, but at that time, I wasn’t sure if it was the right choice. Now, I might feel more confident about it.
Taking Follow-Up Action: I wouldn’t take any follow-up actions, as I will never need to make this decision again. Besides, revisiting this decision would only demotivate me.
