Response to the Tragedy
- CEO Warren Anderson’s arrest and release.




Slide 1: Overview of the Tragedy
"On December 2–3, 1984, a deadly gas leak occurred at the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Methyl isocyanate (MIC), a highly toxic gas, leaked from the plant, exposing over half a million people. This single event took thousands of lives and left a legacy of suffering and environmental damage, making it one of the deadliest industrial disasters in history."

Slide 2: Causes of the Disaster
"There were several reasons this tragedy happened. First, technical failures – safety systems like the vent scrubber and flare tower were inactive or insufficient. Human factors also played a role: employees were undertrained, and safety protocols were neglected. Additionally, Union Carbide’s cost-cutting measures further compromised safety standards."

Slide 3: Timeline of Events
"On December 2, 1984, during routine maintenance, a reaction in an MIC storage tank was accidentally triggered. In the early hours of December 3, the gas started leaking uncontrollably. Efforts to control the leak failed, and within minutes, the gas spread across Bhopal, reaching densely populated areas and leaving residents unprotected."

Slide 4: Human and Environmental Impact
"The immediate human toll was devastating, with an estimated 3,000 to 8,000 deaths within days. Survivors experienced long-term health issues, including respiratory problems, blindness, cancers, and even genetic issues affecting future generations. Environmentally, the tragedy left a lasting impact due to soil and groundwater contamination. Inadequate cleanup meant toxic exposure persisted for decades."

Slide 5: Response and Legal Controversies
"Initially, the government provided evacuation and medical aid. Union Carbide’s response, however, was limited. Its CEO, Warren Anderson, was arrested but later released. After years of legal battles, Union Carbide agreed to a $470 million settlement, which survivors felt was insufficient. The incident raised ethical questions around corporate accountability and justice for the affected families."

Slide 6: Lessons Learned
"The tragedy highlighted critical lessons:

The importance of strict industrial safety and regular maintenance.
Corporate accountability and transparency in operations.
Disaster preparedness and response are crucial in high-risk industries.
Companies must prioritize human lives over cost-cutting measures."

Slide 7: Conclusion
"The Bhopal tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks of industrial negligence. It underscores the importance of placing safety and ethics above financial savings. This disaster calls for improved safety standards worldwide to prevent similar events from happening. 

Thank you, and I’m happy to take any questions."
