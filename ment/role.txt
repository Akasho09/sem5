"How many people do you share your personal life with to a significant extent? 
 How many sources of inspiration do you have for your career development?"
"In a world full of celebrities, influencers, and public figures, whom can we truly look up to? "

Clearly, there are very few individuals with whom we share a significant part of our personal lives, 
and even fewer who genuinely share their lives with us. 
This makes it challenging to find someone with whom we can deeply connect on a personal level.

On the other hand, we often have numerous sources of inspiration for our careers.

Also, Personal life is more important than Carrer life. 
Personal life is vital for a person's:
Well-Being.
Happiness.
Ability to Maintain Relationships.
Foundation for Career Success.
Additionally, a strong personal life influences a person's social responsibilities. 

Do our lives resemble any celebrities on the internet. 
our problems and difficulties are far different from theirs. 


We can narrow down our quest to this based on the above.
We should select a role model with whom we share a deep personal connection.
Additionally, we can look for various sources of inspiration to aid in our career growth.

"Being born into a Muslim family, I had the opportunity to learn about the Sirat-e-Nabi, the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)."
It has always been inspiring for me.

The prophet not only gave us guide by saying things but they also did that throughout their life & 
the things which prophet did throughout their life & advised us to do the same are called sunnahs.

Prophet lived a very simple life.
His living quarters were so tight that when he ﷺ wished to pray, he would tap Āishah (rA) to bend her legs to make room for him to prostrate. 
To drink or bathe, he would reach for the small leather waterskin that hung in his room. 
For months on end, no fire would be kindled for cooking in his home, and his family was content with dates and water 
unless someone gifted them some milk.
‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb (rA) reports that he once entered the room of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to find him lying down and 
noticed that the coarseness of the straw mat under him had left marks on his side. 
Upon noticing that, and the meager rations of barley and leaves, and the leather bag hanging in the corner, 
his eyes welled with tears. The Prophet ﷺ said, “What makes you weep, O son of al-Khaṭṭāb?” He said, 
“O Prophet of Allah, how can I not cry after seeing how the mat has left these marks on your side, and how little you have 
in your food cupboard? Caesar and Chosroes live surrounded by fruits and springs of water, while you are the Messenger of 
God and His chosen one, and yet this is your condition.” The Prophet ﷺ said, “O son of al-Khaṭṭāb, does it not please you that 
these [luxuries] are for us in the Hereafter and for them in this world?” I said, “Of course.”[13].
