If you need someone who looks exactly like you , then you will never do anything new." Neil Degrase tyson "
"Everyone has their own personal life, career, and social responsibilities"

"How many people do you share your personal life with to a significant extent? 
 How many sources of inspiration do you have for your career development?"
"In a world full of celebrities, influencers, and public figures, whom can we truly look up to? "

Clearly, there are very few individuals with whom we share a significant part of our personal lives, 
and even fewer who genuinely share their lives with us. 
This makes it challenging to find someone with whom we can deeply connect on a personal level.

On the other hand, we often have numerous sources of inspiration for our careers.

Also, Personal life is more important than Carrer life. 
Personal life is vital for a person's:
Well-Being.
Happiness.
Ability to Maintain Relationships.
Foundation for Career Success.
Additionally, a strong personal life influences a person's social responsibilities. 

Do our lives resemble any celebrities on the internet. 
our problems and difficulties are far different from theirs.
