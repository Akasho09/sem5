## Definition 
- A republic is a form of government where supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch. 
- The term "republic" comes from the Latin word "res publica," meaning "public thing." 
- The key element is the popular sovereignty that resides in the people and not in a hereditary ruler. 

- A republic is not simply a form of government, but also a political philosophy that emphasizes civic virtue, the rule of law, and the protection of individual rights. 
- It is founded on the belief that the people, through their chosen representatives, should govern themselves and that power should not be concentrated in the hands of a single person or a small group.
