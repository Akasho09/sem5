The Zeigarnik effect was first observed by the Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik in the late 1920s. She and her colleagues noticed that waiters in a restaurant had better recollections of still unpaid orders than those that had already been paid and fulfilled. Zeigarnik then conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the effect.

To prove her hypothesis, Bluma designed few experiments where she gave her subjects 20 tasks to complete. The tasks ranged from manual tasks like clay modelling and mental tasks like maths problems. For one group of participants, she interrupted the tasks in between. Subsequent free recall tests showed that the group that was interrupted remembered the details of the tasks better than the one that was allowed to complete the task.


Looks like a Physiological disorder but nothing like that. There is a proper Science behind it .

SCience involved
The brian parts including the Prefrontal cortex and hippacampus are majorly involved in the Zeigarnik effect.
PFC : This region helps maintain incomplete tasks in active memory, allowing for the cognitive flexibility needed to switch between tasks.
hippocampus : it helps encode memories of incomplete tasks and retrieves them later.
Amygdala (ammigdilla) : The emotional arousal associated with unfinished tasks, such as anxiety or stress, may activate the amygdala, reinforcing the memory of those tasks and prompting the urge to complete them.

It has a analogy to the caches memeory working in computer systems , where the unfinished tasks are temporary saved in cache for easy retrival , a similar concept is here the unfinished tasks are kept in urgent memory to finish them first .

One of the Popular Technique Pomodoro Technique also works on somwewhat the same principle , In pomodoro technique what happens is we do a focused work for some period of time then we leave the tasks as its and take a break . As we leave the tasks unfinished , the brain creates a urge to complete the tasks , thereby motivating us again to do the same work . Thereby helping us to work longer and focused.

One of the oldest tricks in the TV business for keeping viewers tuned into a serial week after week is the cliff-hanger. TV serials often end their episodes where the story is about to take a sudden turn, also known as cliff-hangers. You tune in next week for the resolution because the mystery is ticking away at the back of your mind and to complete the story in your mind.
