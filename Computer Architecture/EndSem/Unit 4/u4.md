## Vector Architecture 
Vector architectures grab sets of data elements scattered about memory, place them into large sequential register files, operate on data in those register files, and then disperse the results back into memory. 
- A single instruction works on vectors of data, which results in dozens of register-register operations on independent data elements.

### Memory latency 
refers to the time delay between a request for data and the delivery of that data. It is the duration between initiating a memory access (e.g., reading or writing data) and when the data becomes available for use by the processor.
