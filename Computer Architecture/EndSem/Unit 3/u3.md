## Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) 

refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple instructions simultaneously during a single clock cycle. 

It exploits the potential overlap between independent instructions in a program, allowing them to be executed in parallel to improve performance. 

ILP is a key concept in modern processor architectures and is enabled through techniques like 

- pipelining, 
- superscalar execution, and 
- out-of-order execution.

## Forwarding :

Forwarding (or bypassing) is a technique used in pipelined processors to resolve Read After Write (RAW) hazards without stalling the pipeline. It allows the output of one pipeline stage to be directly used as input to another stage, bypassing the need to wait for the data to be written back to the register file.
