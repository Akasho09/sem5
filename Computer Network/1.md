<!-- 1. Application Layer (Layer 7): -->
- provides user interface for sending data. 
- The application generates the data that needs to be sent. 
- It could be a file, message, or any application-specific data.
- also provides diff protocols for file transfer like  HTTP(Fow wen acesses), FTP(for file transfer), or another application protocol.
<!-- 2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): -->
- The presentation layer `formats`(there might be diff formats( ASCII or UNICODE etc) between sender and reciever) the data for the application layer. 
- It handles encryption(if we want to send data encrypted ), compression, and translation of data formats if needed.
<!-- 3. Session Layer (Layer 5): -->
- The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between the two communicating hosts.
- also adds checkpoints in data transfer.
- It organizes and synchronizes the dialogue between the presentation layers of the sender and receiver.
<!-- 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4): -->
- Protocol Used: TCP or UDP (assuming TCP for reliable data transfer).
Functionality:
- The transport layer is responsible for breaking the data into segments if it is too large for the network layer to handle.
- It assigns the source port p1 and the destination port p2.(to identify which application is data send).
- Each `segment` includes a header with source port, destination port, sequence number, and error-checking data.
- TCP also handles flow control, error correction, and reassembly of the data at the destination.
<!-- 5. Network Layer (Layer 3): -->
- Protocol Used: IP
Functionality:
- The network layer handles logical addressing and routing of the data.
- It encapsulates each transport layer segment into an `IP packet`.
- The packet header contains the source IP address IP1 and the destination IP address IP2.
- If the data is too large for the network layer, IP fragmentation occurs, breaking the packet into smaller packets that fit the network's Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).
<!-- 6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): -->
Functionality:
- The data link layer is responsible for `framing` and physical addressing.
It takes each IP packet and encapsulates it into a frame suitable for the local network (e.g., Ethernet frame).
- The frame includes the source `physical address` 15 and the physical address of the router (gateway) on the local network (obtained via ARP).
- If the data link layer also fragments the data, it further divides it into smaller frames.
<!-- 7. Physical Layer (Layer 1): -->
Functionality:
The physical layer converts the frames into bits and transmits them over the physical medium (e.g., cables, fiber optics).
Intermediate Device (Router):
When the frame reaches the router, it checks the destination IP address and forwards it to the appropriate network (LAN2 in this case).
Router Actions:
Data Link Layer (Layer 2): The router receives the frame, checks the physical address, and strips the frame header.
Network Layer (Layer 3): The router examines the IP packet, checks the destination IP address (IP2), and uses its routing table to determine the best path. It then encapsulates the packet into a new frame for LAN2.
Data Link Layer (Layer 2): The new frame includes the routerâ€™s physical address on LAN2 as the source and 85 (destination's physical address) as the destination.
Destination Node (IP2, Physical Address 85):
<!-- 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1): -->
Receives the bits over the network medium and reconstructs the frames.
2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
Receives the frame, checks the destination physical address (85), and strips the frame header to pass the IP packet to the network layer.
3. Network Layer (Layer 3):
Checks the destination IP address (IP2) to ensure it matches its own.
Reassembles fragmented IP packets if necessary and strips the IP header.
4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):
The transport layer reassembles the data segments into the correct order using the sequence numbers.
Checks for errors and acknowledges received segments if TCP is used.
Once reassembled, it delivers the data to the correct application using the destination port p2.
5. Session Layer (Layer 5), Presentation Layer (Layer 6), and Application Layer (Layer 7):
The session layer ensures the correct session is maintained and terminates once communication ends.
The presentation layer formats the data for the application if necessary.
Finally, the application layer receives the data intended for the application at the destination.
