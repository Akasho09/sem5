--"Characterstics of effective communication" :
1. Delivery
2. Accuracy
3. Timeliness
4. Jitter: Variation in the packet arrival time

"Components of a data communication system" :
1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Transmission medium
5. Protocol

"Topology" :
1. Mesh
2. Star
3. Bus
4. Ring

"NETWORKS" :
# A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes)
# connected by communication links.
"Categories of Networks "
1. Local Area Networks (LANs)
#  Short distances
#  Designed to provide local interconnectivity
2.  Wide Area Networks (WANs)
#  Long distances
#  Provide connectivity over large areas
3. Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
#  Provide connectivity over areas such as a city, a campus

"protocol" :
# A protocol is synonymous with rule. It consists of a set of
# rules that govern data communications.

"Elements of a Protocol": 
1. Syntax
#  Structure or format of the data
#  Indicates how to read the bits
2. Semantics
#  Interprets the meaning of the bits
#  Knows which fields define what action
3. Timing
#  When data should be sent and what
#  Speed at which data should be sent or speed at which it is being
# received.

--"Internet"  : 
# Collection of connected computers.
--"IP ADDRESS:" 
# assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication
#  curl ifconfig.me -s
--"PORTS" : 
#  a port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.
