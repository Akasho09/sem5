--"Characterstics of effective communication" :
1. Delivery
2. Accuracy
3. Timeliness
4. Jitter: Variation in the packet arrival time

"Components of a data communication system" :
1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Transmission medium
5. Protocol

"Topology" :
1. Mesh
2. Star
3. Bus
4. Ring

"NETWORKS" :
# A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes)
# connected by communication links.
"Categories of Networks "
1. Local Area Networks (LANs)
#  Short distances
#  Designed to provide local interconnectivity
2.  Wide Area Networks (WANs)
#  Long distances
#  Provide connectivity over large areas
3. Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
#  Provide connectivity over areas such as a city, a campus

"protocol" :
# A protocol is synonymous with rule. It consists of a set of
# rules that govern data communications.

"Elements of a Protocol": 
1. Syntax
#  Structure or format of the data
#  Indicates how to read the bits
2. Semantics
#  Interprets the meaning of the bits
#  Knows which fields define what action
3. Timing
#  When data should be sent and what
#  Speed at which data should be sent or speed at which it is being
# received.

--"Internet"  : 
# Collection of connected computers.
--"IP ADDRESS:" 
# assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication
#  curl ifconfig.me -s
--"PORTS" : 
#  a port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.

--"OSI(open system interconnection) MODEL" :-> (All People Seem To Need Data Processing) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APdjpzRlZEU)
is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a communication system or network.
# 7 layers
1. Application 
a). provides interface btwen layers and applications.
b). Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.
c). Key Components: Web browsers, email clients, file transfer software.

2. Presentation.
a). Translates data between the application layer and the network.
b). it handles data encryption, decryption, compression, and conversion (e.g., character encoding, data format translation).
c). Key Components: Data encryption, compression, data translation.

3. Session
a). Manages sessions between applications. 
b). It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications, handling session management and synchronization.
c). Key Components: Session management, authentication, authorization.

4. Transport
a). Ensures end-to-end communication, error recovery, and flow control.
It segments and reassembles data, making sure it arrives in order and without errors.
b). Data Unit: Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP).
c). also called 'end to end layer'
d). protocols used i). TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL) ii). UDP(USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL).
e). Key Components: Ports, TCP/UDP, flow control, error checking.
{It assigns the source port p1 and the destination port p2. }

5. Network
a). Assigns IP address to devices .
b). Data Unit: Packets.
c). Switching and Routing Techniques are used.
d). adds source and destination to data packets .
e). determines best path for travelling.
{It encapsulates each transport layer segment into an IP packet. The packet header contains the source IP address IP1 and the destination IP address IP2.}

6. Data Link.
a). Encodes & Decodes data packets sent by network layer called as frames & ensures no error in data packets.
b). uses 2 protocols i). HDLC(High level data link control). PPP (Point to point protocol).
c). divided into 2 sub layers i). MAC (media acess control) --Manages protocol access to the physical network medium. ii). LLC (Logic link control).--Handles error checking and flow control.
d). Responsible for adding headers and trailers to these frames .
e). Data Unit: Frames.
{The frame includes the source physical address 15 and the physical address of the router (gateway) on the local network (obtained via ARP).}

7. Physical Layer
a). Deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission.
it Converts digital signals into electric signals.
b). Data Unit: 'Bits'
c). Key Components: Cables, switches, network interface cards (NICs), hubs, connectors, etc.
d). bit level synchronization.
e). Determines type of Topology.
f). Determines transmission mode e.g simplex,duplex etc.
g). Determines bit rate.

'Bit Rate'
Bit rate is the transmission of a number of bits per second. 
On the other hand, the Baud rate is defined as the number of signal units per second.
Bit Rate = Baud Rate × No. of Bits per Baud


Transmission time = Total byte size / Bandwidth .
