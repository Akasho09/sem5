## What is a Socket?
A socket is like a door through which data enters and leaves a computer over a network. It connects two applications (like a client and a server) so they can send messages to each other.

## 2. What is a Port?
A port is like the address of a particular door on your computer. It helps direct data to the right application. For example, a web browser might use port 80 to talk to a web server.


## 3. Where are Ports Physically Located? (NIC)
Ports are not physical; they are logical/software endpoints. However, data sent to a port travels through the NIC (Network Interface Card), which is the physical hardware that connects your computer to a network (like Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

## 4. Phone Call: Connection-Oriented or Connectionless?
A phone call is connection-oriented because you first establish a connection (dialing and connecting), talk, and then close the connection. It ensures reliable communication.

## 5. Post Service: Connection-Oriented or Connectionless?
A postal service is connectionless. You send a letter, but there is no active connection between the sender and receiver. It does not guarantee immediate delivery or confirmation.
