IP Adress:
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet.
1. changes based on location.
2. assigned manually or dynamically.
3. x.x.x.x (0<=x<256)  IPv4 -32 bits   (ifconfig)
4. The IPv4 address is divided into two parts: Network ID and Host ID. NID(Network ID) = 8bit, and HID(Host ID) = 24bit
Notations :
a). Dotted Decimal Notation
b). Hexadecimal Notation

There are one 256 Networks and even a small organization must buy 16M computer(Host) to purchase one network. 
That’s why we need classfull addressing.

"Classful Addressing" : The order of bits in the first octet determines the classes of the IP address
IP Class	Address Range	Maximum number of networks
Class A  	1-126	       126 (0000000,1111111 excluded)
Class B 	128-191	       16384
Class C 	192-223        2097152
Class D	    224-239	       Reserve for multitasking
Class E	    240-254        Reserved for Research and development

" Class A " : 
IP addresses belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts. 
# first bit 0 fixed => 50% of total address available
# no of hosts possible in every network = 2^24 -2 (x.0.0.0 is address of host itself and x.255.255.255 is broadcast address {used to share somehing to all networks}).
# The default subnet mask for Class A is 255.x.x.x. 
# IP addresses belonging to class A ranges from 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255. 
# any "ip address & mask = network id" ;

"Class B ":
IP address belonging to class B is assigned to networks that range from medium-sized to large-sized networks. 
# The network ID is 14 bits long.
# The host ID is 16 bits long.
# First 2 bits 10 fixed. =>25% of total addresses
# The default subnet mask for class B is 255.255.x.x. Class B has a total of: 
# 2^14 = 16384 network address
# 2^16 – 2 = 65534 host address
# Address Range=128-191=64 (2^6)
# IP addresses belonging to class B ranges from 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255.
