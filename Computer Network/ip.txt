IP Adress:
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet.
1. changes based on location.
2. assigned manually or dynamically.
3. x.x.x.x (0<=x<256)  IPv4 -32 bits   (ifconfig)
4. The IPv4 address is divided into two parts: Network ID and Host ID. NID(Network ID) = 8bit, and HID(Host ID) = 24bit
Notations :
a). Dotted Decimal Notation
b). Hexadecimal Notation

'IPv4'
There are one 256 Networks and even a small organization must buy 16M computer(Host) to purchase one network. 
That’s why we need classfull addressing.

"Classful Addressing" : The order of bits in the first octet determines the classes of the IP address
IP Class	Address Range	Maximum number of networks
Class A  	1-126	       126 (0000000,1111111 excluded)  -->50%
Class B 	128-191	       16384  ->25%
Class C 	192-223        2097152 ->12.5%
Class D	    224-239	       Reserve for multitasking ->6.25%
Class E	    240-254        Reserved for Research and development ->6.25%

" Class A " : 
IP addresses belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts. 
- first bit 0 fixed => 50%(2^31) of total address available
# no of hosts possible in every network = 2^24 -2 (x.0.0.0 is address of host itself and x.255.255.255 is broadcast address {used to share somehing to all networks}).
Maximum number of networks=2^7-2=126
- The default subnet mask for Class A is 255.x.x.x. 
{ ip address & mask = network id }
# IP addresses belonging to class B ranges from 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255.


"Class B ":
IP address belonging to class B is assigned to networks that range from medium-sized to large-sized networks. 
- The network ID is 14 bits long.
- The host ID is 16 bits long.
First 2 bits 10 fixed. => 25% (2^30)of total addresses
# The default subnet mask for class B is 255.255.x.x. 
Class B has a total of: 
~ 2^14 = 16384 network address
~ 2^16 – 2 = 65534 host address
- Address Range=128-191=64 (2^6)
# IP addresses belonging to class B ranges from 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255.

"Class C":
IP addresses belonging to class C are assigned to small-sized networks.
- The network ID is 24 bits long.
- The host ID is 8 bits long.
first 3 fixed bits 110. => 12.5% (2^29) of total addresses.
The default subnet mask for class C is 255.255.255.x
- Address Range=192-223=32 (2^5)
Class C has a total of:
~ 2^21 = 2097152 network address
~ 2^8 – 2 = 254 host address
# IP addresses belonging to class C range from 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255.

"Class D":
# IP address belonging to class D is reserved for "multi-casting". 
The higher-order bits of the first octet of IP addresses belonging to class D is always set to 1110. =>6.25% (2^28) addresses
# The remaining bits are for the address that interested hosts recognize.
- Class D does not possess any subnet mask. IP addresses belonging to class D range from 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255.
address range = 224-239.

"Class E":
IP addresses belonging to class E are reserved for experimental and research purposes.
# IP addresses of class E range from 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255. 
- This class doesn’t have any subnet mask. 
The higher-order bits of the first octet of class E are always set to 1111.=>6.25%
# address range = 240-255.



"Classless Addressing":
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for efficiently allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets. 
Unlike classful addressing, which divides IP addresses into fixed classes (A, B, C, etc.), CIDR allows for variable-length subnet masks (VLSM). 
This means that networks can be divided into smaller, more flexible subnets according to their specific needs, rather than being constrained by predefined class boundaries.
Notation : ip address / |network id|
e.g 192.10.11.12/25 => 25 bits are network id and 7 bits are host id.

"subnetting":
When a bigger network is divided into smaller networks, 
to maintain security, then that is known as Subnetting. So, maintenance is easier for smaller networks.
- Subnetting divides domains of the broadcast so that traffic is routed efficiently, which helps in improving network performance.
For communicating between subnets, routers are used.
'VLSM' - Variable length subnet masking 
{ 126 | 62 | 62 }
Some Values Calculated in Subnetting:
1. Number of subnets : 2(Given bits for mask – No. of bits in default mask)
2. Subnet address : AND result of subnet mask and the given IP address
4. Number of hosts per subnet : 2(32 – Given bits for mask) – 2.
