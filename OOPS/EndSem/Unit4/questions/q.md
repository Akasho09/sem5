## Benefits of Using Packages in Java
Packages in Java are a way to organize classes and interfaces. They provide modularity, reusability, and security. Here are the key benefits of using packages:

Organization:
Packages help organize related classes and interfaces, making the project easier to understand and maintain.

Name Conflicts Avoidance:
Packages allow you to group classes with the same name in different namespaces, avoiding naming conflicts.

Access Protection:
Using protected and default access levels, you can control the visibility of classes and methods within a package.

Reusability:
Classes in packages can be reused in multiple applications.

Modularity:
Packages enable better modularity in large projects by grouping related functionality.

Easy Maintenance:
Packages make it easier to locate and maintain code by grouping similar functionalities together.

## Steps to Create and Use a Package in Java
- Create a Package:
Use the package keyword at the beginning of the Java file.
Save the file in a directory structure matching the package name.
- Compile the Package:
Compile the file with the javac command, specifying the `destination` directory using -d.
- Use the Package in Another Class:
Import the package using the import statement.
You can also use the fully qualified name of the class without importing.
