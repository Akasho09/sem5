## Function and Operator Overloading
- `Function overloading` allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but with different parameters (either in number, type, or both). The compiler decides which version of the function to call based on the arguments passed.

- `Operator overloading` allows you to define or redefine the behavior of operators for user-defined types (e.g., classes). For example, you can overload operators like +, -, =, [], (), etc., to work with objects of your class in a natural way.
