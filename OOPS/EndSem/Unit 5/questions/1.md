## Keywords Used to Handle Exceptions in Java
In Java, exceptions are handled using the following key keywords:

- try:
The try block is used to enclose code that may throw an exception. It allows the program to attempt a certain operation and catch any potential exceptions.

- catch:
The catch block is used to handle exceptions that are thrown inside the try block. It follows the try block and defines the type of exception it can catch.

- finally:
The finally block is used to execute important code such as cleanup activities (e.g., closing resources). It runs regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

- throw:
The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.

- throws:
The throws keyword is used in method declarations to specify that a method can throw an exception. It is used to propagate exceptions to the calling method.



## (b) Difference Between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java
In Java, exceptions are categorized into two types:

- Checked Exceptions:
Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The compiler forces you to handle these exceptions explicitly using try-catch or by declaring them with the throws keyword in the method signature. These exceptions are usually due to external factors, such as I/O errors or invalid user input, that the program cannot always predict.
eg: IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException	

- Unchecked Exceptions:
Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. They are checked at runtime. Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException and its descendants. These exceptions often result from programming bugs, such as dividing by zero or accessing an invalid array index.
NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

## d) (i) Difference Between finally and finalize Blocks in Java
In Java, finally and finalize serve different purposes. While they both deal with cleanup, they are used in different contexts.

1. finally Block:
Purpose: The finally block is used to execute important code, such as cleanup code (closing resources, releasing locks, etc.), after a try-catch block. It is guaranteed to execute regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
Usage: It is used in conjunction with try-catch blocks for exception handling and is meant to ensure that certain code runs even if an exception is thrown.
2. finalize Method:
Purpose: The finalize method is a method of the Object class that is invoked by the garbage collector just before an object is destroyed. It gives the object a chance to clean up resources (like closing file handles) before it is garbage collected. However, it is not guaranteed to be called and may never be invoked.
Usage: It is generally used to clean up resources before the object is reclaimed by the garbage collector. It is not recommended for routine resource management, as itâ€™s unreliable.

## In Java, Runnable interface must be implemented by a thread if you are not subclassing Thread.

The Runnable interface has only one method: run(), which contains the code to be executed by the thread. If you implement Runnable, you can create a thread by passing an instance of Runnable to the Thread class.
