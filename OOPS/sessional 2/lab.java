/*
 Write a complete multi-threaded program in Java to meet following requirements:
•⁠  ⁠Read matrix [A] m x n
•⁠  ⁠Create m number of threads
•⁠  ⁠Each thread computes summation of elements of one row, i.e. i th row of the
matrix is processed by i th thread. 
•⁠  ⁠Print the results.



Write a multi-threaded program to
have two producer threads, each writes (push) total 7 integer items to the same
(common) stack. The producers enter into sleep state for 500 ms after writing
every item. There is one consumer thread that reads (pop) from the same stack
and enters into sleep state then-after for 600 ms. Assume stack size as 10.
Incorporate all required conditions so that all valid items are popped only once
and there is no stack overflow & underflow.
