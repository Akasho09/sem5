# Packages 
in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. Packages are used for:
- Code Organization:
- Packages can be considered as data encapsulation (or data-hiding).
- Preventing naming conflicts. For example there can be two classes with name Employee in two packages, college.staff.cse.Employee and college.staff.ee.Employee
- Access Control:
Packages provide mechanisms for controlled access to classes and methods using access modifiers.

- javac -d . mypackage/MyClass.java // No need to compile this seprately
- javac -d . MainProgram.java
- java MainProgram
