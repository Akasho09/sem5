"Programming paradigm:" 
Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or
also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.
types : 
1. Imperative programming paradigm: 
based on Von Neumann architecture.
oldest.
It performs step by step task by changing state.
 --Procedural programming paradigm –
 --Object oriented programming –->  The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication.
  The smallest and basic entity is object and all kind of computation is performed on the objects only. More emphasis is on data rather procedure. 
  It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario.
 --Parallel processing approach – 
2. Declarative programming paradigm: 
divided as 
Logic, Functional, Database.

---> "OOP" : Object-Oriented Programming, as name suggests, is a different approach to programming that brings together data and functions that execute on them.
 It basically supports encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. It also includes data hiding feature therefore it is more secure.
 This model is based on real life entities that focuses on by whom task is to be done rather than focusing on what to do.
Example : JAVA, C#, C++, etc.

---> "Structured Programming ": views the 2 core elements of a program ie data & function as 2 diff entities.
e.g: Pascal, ALGOL, C, Modula-2, etc.

"Object:"
An object is an instance of a class, created with specific data.

"Class:"
A class is a template that defines the properties, methods, and variables of a particular type of object.

"Three categories of class members"
− private(default)
• Member cannot be accessed outside the class
− Public
• Member is accessible outside the class
− Protected
• Member can be accessed by child class and acessiable by own also.
