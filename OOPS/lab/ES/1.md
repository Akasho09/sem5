## Type conversions 


## Forward Declaration:class H24
; is used because H24 is referenced inside H12.

## Pure Virtual Function (= 0):
Declaring a function with = 0 makes it a pure virtual function, requiring all derived classes to provide an implementation.
A class containing at least one pure virtual function becomes an abstract class (cannot be instantiated directly)

## The static keyword allows class-level variables and methods that are shared across all instances of the class.
The static keyword has multiple uses in C++:

- Static Variables: Shared among all instances of a class.
Declared inside the class but defined outside the class.
- Static Member Functions: Can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
A static member function belongs to the class itself, not to any object of the class.
It can be called directly using the class name, without creating an object.
Can only access static variables or other static methods of the class.

## cin.ignore();
getline() ;

## bool withdraw(Student *student) {
        for (int i = 0; i < enrolledStudents.size(); ++i) {
            if (enrolledStudents[i]->getId() == student->getId()) {
## enrolledStudents.erase(enrolledStudents.begin() + i);
                cout << student->getName() << " has successfully withdrawn from " << courseName << endl;
                return true;
            }
        }
        cout << student->getName() << " is not enrolled in " << courseName << endl;
        return false;
    }
