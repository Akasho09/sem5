"Static data members" 
are class members that are declared using static keywords. A static member has certain special characteristics which are as follows:

1. Only one copy of that member is created for the entire class and is shared by all the objects of that class, no matter how many objects are created.
2. It is initialized before any object of this class is created, even before the main starts outside the class itself.
3. It is visible can be controlled with the class access specifiers.
4. Its lifetime is the entire program


"Inline functions " :
C++ provides inline functions to reduce the function call overhead. 
An inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of the inline function call. 
This substitution is performed by the C++ compiler at compile time. An inline function may increase efficiency if it is small.
