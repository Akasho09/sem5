(3 pillars of TOC)  
--LAG-- 
1. Language:
'symbols'--> {0,1,2,a,b};
'alphabet'--> finaite set of symbols //𝚺(a,b)
'string' --> collection of alphabet  
=>(aa,ab,ba,bb) of length=2 && (a,b) of length 1  for //𝚺(a,b) ;
# language is collection of strings 
1. finite language
2. infinite language

2. "Automata" :
#  is the study of abstract machines and automata, 
# as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them.

3. Grammer
-> if string is part of language. 
- is defined as quadraple VTPS -
1. Variable
2. Terminal
3. Production rule
4. Start symbol


"kleen closure" :
𝚺(a+b)^* -->infinite language
𝚺^*=𝚺^+ + 𝚺^0(ε); (postive closure + sigma zero or epsilon) 


-- "Determinate Finite Automata " DFA(Q,𝚺,𝛓,q•,F) :  --
Q:-> Set of finite states
𝚺 :-> a,b
𝛓 :-> Transition
q• :-> Start
F :-> Set of final states
# F is a subset of Q
