1. Discuss how assembly language is used with C programming with suitable example. Also
discuss how are software interrupt used in programming with suitable example.
###
- How Software Interrupts are Used in Programming
> A software interrupt is a mechanism to signal the processor that a specific service or function is required. It transfers control to an interrupt service routine (ISR) and is often used for system calls or debugging.
-  In x86 assembly, the INT instruction is used to invoke software interrupts. For example, interrupt INT 21H in DOS provides various services like reading from the keyboard or writing to the screen.
