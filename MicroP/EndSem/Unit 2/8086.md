# 8086 Registers

## 1. General-Purpose Registers
Used for arithmetic, logic, and data transfer operations. Each can be accessed as 16-bit or split into two 8-bit parts (high and low).

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                    | **Split into 8-bit**      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **AX**       | Accumulator for arithmetic and logical operations. | AH (high) and AL (low)   |
| **BX**       | Base register, often used as a memory pointer.      | BH (high) and BL (low)   |
| **CX**       | Counter register, used in loops and string operations. | CH (high) and CL (low) |
| **DX**       | Data register, used in multiplication, division, and I/O. | DH (high) and DL (low) |

## 2. Segment Registers
Used for memory segmentation, allowing the 8086 to address up to **1 MB** of memory.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **CS**       | Code Segment: Points to the segment containing executable code. |
| **DS**       | Data Segment: Points to the segment containing data.            |
| **SS**       | Stack Segment: Points to the segment containing the stack.      |
| **ES**       | Extra Segment: Points to an additional segment for data.        |

## 3. Pointer and Index Registers
Used for memory addressing and stack operations.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **SP**       | Stack Pointer: Points to the top of the stack (relative to SS). |
| **BP**       | Base Pointer: Used for accessing stack parameters and data.    |
| **SI**       | Source Index: Used in string/memory operations (relative to DS). |
| **DI**       | Destination Index: Used in string/memory operations (relative to ES). |

## 4. Instruction Pointer
| **Register** | **Purpose**                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **IP**       | Instruction Pointer: Points to the next instruction to execute (relative to CS). |

---

## 5. Flags Register
The Flags Register contains **status** and **control flags**. It is a 16-bit register.

| **Flag**          | **Description**                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **CF** (Carry)    | Set if a carry or borrow occurs in arithmetic.   |
| **ZF** (Zero)     | Set if the result of an operation is zero.       |
| **SF** (Sign)     | Set if the result of an operation is negative.   |
| **OF** (Overflow) | Set if an overflow occurs in arithmetic.         |
| **PF** (Parity)   | Set if the number of 1 bits in the result is even. |
| **AF** (Auxiliary Carry) | Set if a carry occurs between nibbles (used in BCD). |
| **TF** (Trap)     | Enables single-step debugging mode.              |
| **IF** (Interrupt) | Enables or disables maskable interrupts.        |
| **DF** (Direction) | Controls string operations (increment/decrement). |
